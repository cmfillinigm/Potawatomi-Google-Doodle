# My Topic Google Doodle

The are estimated to be about 270,000 different species of flowers on the earth. Flowers have long had cultural significance for people of all different background. Many flowers have medicinal benifts. They are often incorporated into teas either for their medicinal properties or purely for flavor.  Flowers are often given as gifts for a variety of occasions. They are given romantically, in congradulations, in thanks, in sympathy, and for many more reasons.

For my doodle I wanted to use flowers to provide a woodland type wimsical feel. Something you would associate with fairy houses.
